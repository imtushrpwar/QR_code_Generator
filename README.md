Text to QR Code Generator
A simple web-based application that converts any text or URL into a QR code. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for generating QR codes instantly.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the basic structure and layout.
CSS: Handles styling, including the layout and animations.
JavaScript: Manages the QR code generation logic and user input validation.

Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Open index.html in your browser.
Enter any text or URL in the input box.
Click the "Generate QR Code" button to create the QR code.
The QR code will appear below the input field, ready for scanning or saving.

How It Works
The JavaScript code sends the input text or URL to a QR code API, which generates and displays the QR code. The app includes error handling to ensure only valid input is processed.
